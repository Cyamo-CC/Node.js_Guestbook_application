Guestbook application created usind Node.js and express
This was Project 1 on my FullStack-course

This app is deployed to heroku at:
https://project-1-node-js-guestbook.herokuapp.com/
!HOWEVER!
currently links between the pages do NOT work in cloud enviroment.
My next step will be fixing them. you can navigate the sites by manually adding correct tags to the end of urls.
